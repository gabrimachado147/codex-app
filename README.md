# Codex App

A simple content management app built with Expo.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Node.js**
   - Use the latest LTS version (Node 18+ works well with Expo).

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   The repository includes an `.npmrc` file which enables `legacy-peer-deps` for compatibility.

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This executes `npx expo start` with telemetry disabled. Expo Developer Tools will open in your browser.

4. **Open the app**
   - Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your device, **or**
   - Launch an Android or iOS simulator from Expo Developer Tools.

### Additional Notes

- You can install the Expo CLI globally if you plan to use Expo commands directly:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
- For iOS development, ensure Xcode is installed. For Android, install Android Studio or use the Expo Go app on a physical device.

### Web Support

From Expo Developer Tools, press `w` to open the web version of the app in your browser.
